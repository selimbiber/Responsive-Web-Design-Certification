## My Description:

    Instead of wasting time on an original design, I coded a page similar to the one given as an example.

### User Stories:

- [x] Your product landing page should have a header element with a corresponding id="header"

- [x] You can see an image within the header element with a corresponding id="header-img" (A logo would make a good image here)
  
- [x] Within the #header element, you can see a nav element with a corresponding id="nav-bar"

- [x] You can see at least three clickable elements inside the nav element, each with the class nav-link

- [x] When you click a .nav-link button in the nav element, you are taken to the corresponding section of the landing page

- [x] You can watch an embedded product video with id="video"

- [x] Your landing page has a form element with a corresponding id="form"

- [x] Within the form, there is an input field with id="email" where you can enter an email address

- [x] The #email input field should have placeholder text to let users know what the field is for

- [x] The #email input field uses HTML5 validation to confirm that the entered text is an email address

- [x] Within the form, there is a submit input with a corresponding id="submit"

- [x] When you click the #submit element, the email is submitted to a static page (use this mock URL: https://www.freecodecamp.com/email-submit)

- [x] The navbar should always be at the top of the viewport

- [x] Your product landing page should have at least one media query

- [x] Your product landing page should utilize CSS flexbox at least once
